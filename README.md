# Quiz-Management-System

### Proposed System

The objective of the proposed system is to reduce the overlap between E-learning management systems and Quiz management systems and to build a community where users can create and attempt quizzes of various types shared by other users on the website. It proposes a standalone online quiz management system with an aesthetically appealing design and integrated group facilities that can be taken advantage of by institutions and organisations. It allows users to create their own quizzes with different types of questions, form groups and attend a variety of quizzes created by other users on the site. It is equipped with option-wise marking, negative marking and an auto grading system that makes the process of evaluating quizzes quick and efficient. It is also built with a two-way feedback system that can help bridge the gap between the quiz taker and the quiz organiser. Quizzes also come with a pdf export option that can be made use of whenever necessary.
Another main highlight of this system is the different available levels of visibility modes that introduces a form of abstraction into the system. Users can create quizzes containing both objective and subjective questions. Each quiz that is created is grouped under one of three visibility modes which can be changed by the quiz creator at any point of time.
Public quizzes are globally visible and can be attempted by any registered user on the website. Protected quizzes are also globally visible but are tagged with a unique identifier (a quiz code) and only those users with access to this quiz code can attempt these quizzes. Private quizzes are not globally visible and can only be attempted by the members of the groups that they have been added to.
